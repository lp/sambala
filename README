I am no longer supporting this gem.
Fork if you will... at your own risks and perils!

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 This class acts as a Ruby wrapper around the smbclient command line utility, allowing access to Samba (SMB, CIFS) shares from Ruby.
 What's special about Sambala's implementation, is that it allows for both both queue
 and interactive commands operations.  While interactive mode is invoked in a blocking manner, the queue mode behaves as a non-blocking, multi-threaded, background process.

 Sambala works on Unix derivatives operating systems (Linux, BSD, OSX, else), as long as the operating system has the smbclient utility installed somewhere in the environment's PATH.
 
 Sambala supports most, but not all, smbclient features.  I didn't to this point implement commands relying on posix server support, because I wanted Sambala to be server agnostic.  If some commands or interfaces you would like to use is not supported by Sambala, email me and I may answer with a quick feature update when feasible.

Example:

  samba = Sambala.new(  :domain   =>  'NTDOMAIN', 
                      :host     =>  'sambaserver',
                      :share    =>  'sambashare',
                      :user     =>  'walrus', 
                      :password =>  'eggman')
                      
  samba.cd('myfolder')   # =>  true
  samba.put(:from => 'aLocalFile.txt')    # =>  [false, "aLocalFile.txt does not exist\r\n"]
  samba.close
